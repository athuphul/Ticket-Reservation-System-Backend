# Ticket-Reservation-System-Backend
This is the backend engine that I built in Java for a movie ticket reservation system, as part of a class project.

It uses a variety of data structures. I created a custom data structure by using Hash Tables and Linked Lists.

I have also implemented core fundamental Object Oriented Programming principles - Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation. The project objective was to create a comprehensive professional application.

The program has the ability to cache (or store) user orders, thereby making this a fully fledged application that can be deployed.

I learnt a lot in this project, and I hope I can put these programming practices to good use!
